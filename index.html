		<h2>My favorite Hobby / Activity</h2>

			<p>My favorite hobby is volleyball. I wouldn't even call it a hobby anymore. In Norway the Sport everyone plays is football (soccer). And as every other kid in 
		Norway, I wanted to be a professional football player, but after a while understood that I would 
		never be good enough to get to the level I wanted to get to. That's about the same time as when 
		I started playing volleyball. Volleyball was different. I loved playing volleyball becoming 
		better and the sense of achievement coming with that. This is my sport I though. After some 
		years I went to the other side of Norway to go to a high school specialized for volleyball 
		players. In the years there I tough about what I would do after high school. I had a big dilemma.
		Whether to go to college in the US or to pursue professional beach volleyball right out of high 
		school.</p>
